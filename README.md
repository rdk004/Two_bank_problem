# Two_bank_problem
There are two banks. Let us call them bank 0 and bank 1. A man has to carry a tiger, a cow and a pile of hay all from bank 0 to bank 1 with the help of a boat. He can carry only one of the three at a time and can't leave the cow with the hay or the tiger. What is the optimum number of steps (lowest) required to do so? To find out, do check this.
